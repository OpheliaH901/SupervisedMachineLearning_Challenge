## Fit a LogisticRegression model and RandomForestClassifier model

Create a LogisticRegression model, fit it to the data, and print the model's score. Do the same for a RandomForestClassifier. You may choose any starting hyperparameters you like. Which model performed better? How does that compare to your prediction? Write down your results and thoughts.

## Revisit the Preprocessing: Scale the data

The data going into these models was never scaled, an important step in preprocessing. Use `StandardScaler` to scale the training and testing sets. Before re-fitting the LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier models on the scaled data, make another prediction about how you think scaling will affect the accuracy of the models. Write your predictions down and provide justification.

Fit and score the LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier models on the scaled data. How do the model scores compare to each other, and to the previous results on unscaled data? How does this compare to your prediction? Write down your results and thoughts.
